# MiniCut

MiniCut is a tiny video editor for macOS and iOS.

## Description

"MiniCut" is a tiny video editor, inspired by iMovie. Using MiniCut, users can import, edit and compose video and audio clips, along with titles and custom backgrounds. It provides a familiar interface with a multi-track timeline, a library browser, an interactive live preview and an inspector, making it easy and intuitive for users to create their own movies.

The project is built using SpriteKit and AVFoundation, the powerful technologies that underpin many casual games on Apple platforms. Architectually, it is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel paradigm, applying the observer pattern together with delta updates to the scene hierarchy for efficient and reliable coordination between model and presentation. By including a small compatibility layer, MiniCut seamlessly runs both on macOS and iOS with a shared codebase and is therefore easy to integrate into a real app.

## Open Source

The project includes a section of the open-source-movie 'Big Buck Bunny', released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license ((c) copyright 2008, Blender Foundation / www.bigbuckbunny.org), for demonstration purposes and to make it easy to get started exploring the app.
